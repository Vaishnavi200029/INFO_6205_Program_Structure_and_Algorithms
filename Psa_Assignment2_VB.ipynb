Finding the Longest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph Given a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E), where V represents the set of vertices and E represents the set of directed edges, find the longest path from a source vertex s to a destination vertex t. If there are multiple longest paths, you may output any one of them.\n",

        "We may use the above topological sorting algorithm to determine the longest path in a directed acyclic network. The formula for solving this issue is as follows:\n",
        "1. Create an array D with the size |V|, where D[u] is the longest path from source vertex s to destination vertex u. Initialise every entry in D to a negative number, with the exception of D[s] = 0.\n",

        "3. Let Adj stand for G's representation in an adjacency list.\n",
        "4. Use the updated technique to perform a topological sort as follows:\n",

        "5. The length of the longest path from source vertex s to destination vertex t will be represented by the value D[t] when the topological sort has been completed.\n",
        "6. Start at vertex t and go backwards using these methods to recreate the longest path:\n",

        "Create a list or stack from scratch to hold the longest path.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Beginning at vertex t, move edges backward by choosing the following vertex v such that D[v] = D[u] – 1, where u is the present vertex. Include v in the list.\n",

        "With a twist on this topic, we'll investigate the idea of reachability between two nodes in a weighted graph. You are given a weighted directed graph, and your objective is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify not only whether node A can be reached from node B but also the least expensive way to do so.\n",
        "A weighted directed graph G with nodes and directed edges is provided to you. The cost of travelling each directed edge from node u to node v is represented by the positive weight w(u, v) that is associated with that edge. Additionally, you receive nodes A and B.\n",
